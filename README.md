# CRUD App - Next.JS

## CRUD Next.js
This project was developed during an Udemy course, with the intent to practice and get a little perspective on the back-end integration with the data base. 

## Technologies:
Next.JS 12.2<br />
Tailwind v3<br />
Firebase 8.8.0

## A little more on the project
The Project is very simple, a basic CRUD, it looks same as it was presented on the class, I just added Overwatch to it, changed the name/age to character name/function and once you submit a new character it gives you the link to the character page.<br />
The link `https://playoverwatch.com/pt-br/heroes/${heroi}/`, in which `heroi` is the name input filtered, without spaces, punctuation, and for Soldier:76 I had to an `if`, because the project is in Portuguese and the Overwatch link is in English.

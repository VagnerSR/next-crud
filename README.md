# CRUD App - Next.JS

## CRUD Next.js
This project was developed to practice and gain some insights into integrating the back-end with a database. 

## Technologies:
Next.JS 12.2<br />
Tailwind v3<br />
Firebase 8.8.0

## A little more on the project
The project is a simple CRUD application with a focus on managing characters. It builds upon the basic CRUD functionality by incorporating Overwatch characters. Instead of the traditional name/age fields, it utilizes character name and function. Upon submitting a new character, the application generates a link to the character's page.

The generated link follows the format: `https://playoverwatch.com/pt-br/heroes/${hero}/`, where `${hero}` represents the filtered input name without spaces or punctuation. Additionally, an `if` statement is implemented specifically for the character "Soldier: 76" due to language differences between the project (in Portuguese) and the Overwatch link (in English).
